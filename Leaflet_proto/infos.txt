Points à aborder demain : 


-Kothic js review

	-library to render maps, using JSON data (specific json data)
	-unusable directly, even examples doesn't use directly kothic functions
	-Integrated by leaflet js

-Leaflet review 

	-library including kothic js
	-allow to render maps on a canvas (html5)
	-two ways to renders maps
		-server based with tiles (js files containing geoJSON data)
			-too detailed
			-need a server
			-tiles can be generated with a python script on a postGIS database
		-desktop based
			-use a function to draw geoJSON data directly on the canvas
			-many others functions to draw or add objects (polygons, markers, ...)



Way i imagine the editor :


Javascript editor with several tools
-Elements of the map stored as geoJSON data => layers = geoJSON data
	Save layers => generate geoJSON
	Load layers => load existing geoJSON
-Information on elements of the map stored with the elements itself in the geoJSON format as "properties"
-Style of the map stored as CSS Like => need to find an idea on how link geoJSON data to a specific style.
	Save Style => generate sort of CSS file
	Load style => load existing CSS to apply to any element of the map (if the style is compatible with the element)
-Sort of language to edit map quickly or easily :
	with a sort of console : "createRect(50.2, 55.3)" => create a rectangle on the map
	With files => which could be loaded to draw their content on the map (style/elements)

-Database to store elements or information of current map
	Allow user to store a layer in the database (elements of the layer and information : density, population, etc...)
	Allow user to "load" existing layer from the database, to avoid recreating the wheel
	Show elements user could add to a region of the map -> the user want to add usefull information on the france country, the database find and display the different things he founds on the database about the france -> need the layers to be well descripted on the database
